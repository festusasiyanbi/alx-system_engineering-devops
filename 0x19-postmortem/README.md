Postmortem: Webstack Outage Incident at my company.

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 8th, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 11, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: The user registration service experienced a complete outage during the incident. Users were unable to sign up for accounts, resulting in a 20% drop in new user registrations.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured database connection pool that led to a resource exhaustion issue. The database connection pool was set to an insufficient maximum connection limit, causing the pool to become exhausted and preventing new connections from being established.

Timeline:
- June 10, 2023, 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when the engineering team received multiple customer complaints about registration failures.
- Investigation: The engineering team initially suspected a network issue and conducted a thorough analysis of the network infrastructure and related services.
- Misleading Paths: Due to a misleading monitoring alert related to database latency, the team initially focused on optimizing database queries and indexes.
- Escalation: As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the database administration team for further investigation.
- May 10, 2023, 6:00 PM: The root cause, a misconfigured database connection pool, was identified.
- Resolution: The team increased the maximum connection limit in the database connection pool configuration, allowing new connections to be established.
- May 11, 2023, 2:00 AM: The incident was resolved, and the user registration service was fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue was caused by a misconfigured database connection pool. The maximum connection limit was set too low, leading to the exhaustion of available connections. To fix the issue, the maximum connection limit was increased to an appropriate value, allowing new connections to be established and restoring the functionality of the user registration service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Perform a comprehensive review of all critical system configurations to ensure they align with best practices and scalability requirements.
2. Implement automated monitoring and alerting for critical services and components, including database connection pools, to promptly identify and address similar issues in the future.
3. Conduct regular load testing to validate system capacity and identify potential bottlenecks before they impact users.
4. Establish clear escalation paths and communication channels to enable efficient collaboration and timely resolution of incidents.
5. Develop and maintain a central knowledge base documenting past incidents, their root causes, and resolutions to facilitate learning and prevent recurring issues.

Moving forward, the engineering team will prioritize these tasks:
- Update the system documentation to include detailed instructions on configuring database connection pools with appropriate limits.
- Enhance the monitoring system to provide real-time visibility into the status and usage of critical resources.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of other critical system configurations to identify and address potential performance and scalability concerns.

By implementing these measures and learning from this incident, we aim to improve the resilience and reliability of our webstack infrastructure, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Remember, even in the face of challenges, maintaining a positive and proactive approach helps us grow stronger as a team. Together, we can overcome any obstacle that comes our way!
